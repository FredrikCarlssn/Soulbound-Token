# Soulbound Tokens: A Proof of Concept Project

This project is a proof of concept for Soulbound Tokens. It is divided into two main components:

1. `React Front-End`: This part of the project handles the user interface and interactions.

2. `Smart Contract Framework`: This component is responsible for deploying the smart contract that holds all tokens.

For more detailed information, please refer to the documentation located in the respective folders of each component.
