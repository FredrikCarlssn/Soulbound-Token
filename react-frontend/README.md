# Soulbound Token Claiming Grounds

This is the front-end for the Soulbound Token smart contract. The project is built with React and uses the ThirdwebProvider for interacting with the Sepolia blockchain.

## Built With

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - The web framework used
- [ThirdwebProvider](https://docs.thirdweb.com/) - The NFT platform used
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) - Used for routing
- [Styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) - Used for component styling
- [Dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) - Used to manage environment variables

## Project Structure

The main entry point of the application is `index.js`. This file sets up the React application, including the routing for different pages such as the landing page, profile page, and claim page.

The tokens are stored in the `Tokens` folder. This folder contains a JSON file with all the token templates, as well as an `img` folder for all media associated with each token template.

## Available Routes

- `/` - The landing page of the application.
- `/profile` - The profile page where users can view their tokens.
- `/profile/:token/:tokenId` - A detailed view of a specific token owned by the user.
- `/claim` - The page where users can claim new tokens.
- `/claim/:token` - The page where users can claim a specific token.
- `/about` - The about page with information about the project.
